    "summary": "The start of development and what inspired me to make this game",
    "content": "I have been developing a game throughout the summer called “Cheese Crusade.” It's a single player platform fighter with some roguelike elements.  What gave me this idea was the adventure mode in Super Smash Bros. Brawl known as Subspace Emissary. I brought this up to my friends and they also thought it was a good idea. One of them, Javier, said that he is willing to help me with the artwork. That's when I decided to just download Godot and try to learn how to use it.  As of right now, development has paused for now as me and Javier are currently busy with college. We should be able to resume when the semester ends and hope to get some progress done. As for where we are in the project, we are barely implementing map generation and I think I should redo it mainly because of how broken it is. I’m hoping that I will be able to fix it over the winter and have more things done by then.   Please follow my friend Javier on twitter @javi_cd_j for providing the artwork for the project."

    "summary": "I prefer Godot over any other engine",
    "content": "Why am I using Godot and not the other game engines? It's mostly because of the learning curves of the others and how badly it ran on my old laptop. I tried Unity multiple times when I was in middle school and usually ended with me dropping after making my first game. I tried again during the 2020 pandemic when I bought an udemy course for. That also didn't end well as the laptop I had at the time didn’t really function well and I was not able to complete the entire course."
